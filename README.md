# Programming Assignment

In this assignment you will build a simple web application that allows someone to store and display weather information in a database.

The solution should include:

1. A front end web application that allows a user to enter the `time` and `temperature` of a `city`.
2. An api that stores the `time` `temperature` and `city` into a local database (eg.SQLLite)
3. Once entered the front end should display the `time` `temperature` and `city`. It should always display the most recent `temperature` (and no more than single temperature for the same city). 

Preferably your design should be built using the following technologies (if you use a different technology please explain the reasoning):

1. Front end web app - Vue.js
2. Backend api - Node.js (Express and TypeScript preferably)
3. Database - Either NoSQL or RDBMS

Your solution should be...

- User friendly
- Responsive
- Have a clean design
- Contain validation at each layer
